# Hangman_v2
Written by Barry McNickle

version 2 of a simple hangman style game.</n>This version is different in the code has been written using different classes, making the program more versatile.  For example, it should be relatively simple to allow the user to start again once the game is finished or for me to create a second game with a menu allowing user to select which game they would like to play.
